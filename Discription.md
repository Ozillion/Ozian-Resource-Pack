Ozillionian-Nameless-Pack
=========================
Ozillionian PvP Pack is a default minecraft resource pack but with complete GUI revision for better PvP experience as well
as few aesthetical changes. I started working on this pack back in Minecraft 1.3 when Mojang changed several food textures.
I did not want to keep new textures I did't like so I decided to change them to my liking. Later I started reversing even
more new textures to older ones. By changing few blocks and items I think I cursed myself because I can't stop tweaking and
messing around with this pack till this day.
